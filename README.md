serving our own css to the bubble table plugin

1. edit css in .css file
2. minify via this url: https://www.minifier.org/
3. paste minified into .min.css file
4. CDN via this link https://staticaly.com/
5. paste cdn link into plugin

NB: CDN caching is an issue, free services don't offer a purge, will have a look at building a little app so we can style iteratively in that then publish to cdn once
